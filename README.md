Hi, I’m Viktor

I’m a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in software development, cloud technologies, and cybersecurity. I enjoy working on practical projects, learning new tools, and improving my problem-solving skills through real-world applications.

During my studies, I worked on projects involving web development, backend systems, databases, cloud deployment, machine learning, and distributed systems. These experiences helped me build a solid technical foundation and understand how different parts of software systems work together.

I’m currently focused on improving my skills in backend development, cloud platforms, and system-level programming, and I’m actively looking for opportunities to grow as a junior developer or intern in a professional environment.
